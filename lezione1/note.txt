This is a short course based on the YouTube Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL41j7vkwrst7vWMMQ8QjzY2Kg96Hv_NPT

Let's start by saying that it is different from the old CMD, in fact the commands used will generally be different.

PowerShell will be referred to by its abbreviation as PWS

Windows PowerShell is a object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. You can use it in different IDEs but the commonly used is the one provided by Microsoft (PowerShell ISE)

=============== LESSON ===============

Let's start by looking at how to manage (list/stop/start) services with the PWS:

    CMD -> [net start] => show all active services
    CMD -> [net start/stop ServiceName] => start/stop a certain service

    PWS -> [get-service] => show all services, both the stoppered ones and the running ones
    PWS -> [get-service | where-object {$_.status -eq "running"}] => show only the active services
    PWS -> [get-service | where-object {$_.name -eq "ServiceName"}] => look for a specific service
    PWS -> [stop/start-service ServiceName] => stop/start a certain service
