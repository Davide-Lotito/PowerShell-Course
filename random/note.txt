Some commands and information about PWS, which are not part of specific lessons but may be useful:

    * [cd] => move between directories, actually should be "set-location" command
    * [dir] => acts like the Linux "ls" command ("ls" command also can be used), actually should be "get-childitem" command
    * [CTRL + L] => like on Linux
    * commands in the PWS are case-insensitive
    * through the use of the up/down arrows we can scroll through the command history
    * also here with the use of the TAB key there is auto-completion for PWS commands
    * [pwd] => behaves as it does on Linux (alias of [get-location])
    * [Get-EventLog -LogName system -Newest 10] => see the last 10 events in the system log
    * [cls] or [clear] => empty the power shell
    * [Start-Transcript] => creates a file (pattern shown) in which all commands launched in the power shell are saved
    * [Get-Help Copy-Item] => see the manual for the specified command
    * [Get-Help Copy-Item -examples] => see the manual for the specified command, also with some examples
